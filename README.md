### Exercises for Python Language
In this project, 3 questions were solved using Python language. Explanations regarding these questions are given below.
**Exercises 1**

Write a Python script that calculates and prints the sum and average of the digits in the given string, my_str.
my_str = 'TR29abcdqxw10Casd1923yhdf23askdjl04ajdfguj19akflk05ssfıj30lkhu08akdf'

**Exercises 2**

7 students took 2 exams, the top three students will get AA. You were provided with the list of exam marks, use Python string operations, mathematical operations and loops to find average of two exam marks for each student and choose top 3 students programmatically. Announce the top 3 students to the audience:  
List = [‘Ayşe: 75-78’, ‘Berk: 80-60’, ‘Can: 58-61’, ‘Didem: 34-45’,’Erdem: 32-37’, ‘Fatih: 69-75’, ‘Gül: 54-63’] 

**Exercises 3**

A scientist is growing two types of bacteria in a flask. Each type of bacteria produces a chemical that is toxic to the other one. Their features are as follows: 
One mole of Bacteria X produces 0.41 mole of Bacteria X and 0.5 mole of Toxin X every hour. 
One mole of Bacteria Y produces 0.55 mole of Bacteria Y and one mole of Toxin Y every hour. 
One mole of Toxin X kills 0.5% of Bacteria Y every hour. 
One mole of Toxin Y kills 1% of Bacteria X every hour. 
5% of Toxin Y degrades every hour. 
Initial conditions: @ Time = 0 hours : Bacteria X = Bacteria Y = 10 moles, Toxin X = 
Toxin Y = 0 moles. 
Write a Python script that calculates concentrations of Bacteria X, Bacteria Y, Toxin X and 
Toxin Y in the flask every hour and report it as: 
The simulation should stop when the change in concentrations are less than 0.1% (steady state 
conditions) in an hour or when a maximum of 1000 iterations are done.
